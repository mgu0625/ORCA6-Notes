# ORCA 6 Hydroquinone DFT Calculations

### This repository contains Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations of Hydroquinone using ORCA 6. 

This serves as:

- A portfolio project showcasing computational chemistry expertise.
- A tutorial for setting up and running ORCA 6 calculations.
- A guide for setting up a virtual node for local ORCA computations.

## Features
- ORCA 6 setup guide (local and HPC)  
- Step-by-step DFT tutorial for beginners  
- Hydroquinone case study (optimization, frequency, TDDFT)  
- Python & Shell scripts for automation  
- Data visualization & analysis tools  

Compound of Interest for This Demo Will be Hydroquinone **(HYQ)**

Initial Structure is built on Avogadro and coordinates are extracted by selecting Extensions -> ORCA -> Generate ORCA Input then Copy Pasting just the coordinates (ex: After "*0 1... for HYQ") into a separate .xyz file.

Calculation is run on ORCA 6, downloaded on Linux PC (Ubuntu 64-bit Virtual Node built on Virtualbox).


One thing interesting that was observed towards the end of optimization step of PBE with specifically inputted parameters for D3BJ damping.
