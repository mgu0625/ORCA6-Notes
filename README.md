# ORCA 6 DFT Calculations Case Studies

### This repository contains different case studies of Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations done on ORCA 6. 

This serves as:

- A portfolio project showcasing computational chemistry skills.
- A tutorial for running ORCA 6 calculations and performing post calculation visualization using ChemCraft and VMD.
- A guide for setting up a virtual node for local ORCA computations.

## Features
- ORCA 6 input file and submission script setup guide (local and HPC)
- Coordinate extraction for setting up calculations on Avogadro 1
- Step-by-step DFT tutorial using ORCA 6
- Hydroquinone case study (optimization, frequency, TDDFT)  
- Python & Shell scripts for automation  
- Data visualization & analysis tools (VMD, ChemCraft)

Compound of Interest for This Demo Will be Hydroquinone **(HYQ)** and **Maleimide**


Calculation was done on ORCA 6 Linux Version, downloaded and uploaded to both the virtual node and the OSC cluster.

Dr. Frank Nesse from Max-Planck-Institut f√ºr Kohlenforschung and Dr. Chris Cramer from the University of Minnesota are my primary source of learning the principles of Computational/Quantum Chemistry.
